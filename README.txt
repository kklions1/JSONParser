Project by Kevin Klions
This was written for my Object Oriented Programming class

The objective of this program is to be a JSON parser.  This
is not going to be a complete parser. The details of the assignment
do not require numbers to be treated with any special care for example.
The parser only cares if the string of numbers is actually alphanumeric.

This current version is by no means complete, nor does it really compile
correctly. If you want to try to compile it, use cmake from a build directory.
