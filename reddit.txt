I understand that they sell more, they make for very powerful cards, they push the needed fourth rarity and they have a face the player can identify with.

How many more cards of Chandra throwing fire with a sassy flavortext are we going to get? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but isn\u2019t it boring after the third time? We are replacing 9 cards with potential to show us more of the world, 9 cards that could show how pain is afflicted or received there. Cards that could show the resurgence of repressed memories, unexpected loss, being confronted with your own physical limits, or even someone hitting a chair with their little toe. Instead it\u2019s the same image of a girl with flaming hair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t mind Chandra, she\u2019s clich\u00e9 but clich\u00e9s work. I just think she and the rest of the gatewatch are overrepresented. In addition, each story now feels like it is concluded by some Deus Ex trick! Worlds that we explore have inner conflicts. But now these inner conflicts don\u2019t get resolved from within, they get resolved by a few outsiders with demigod-like powers. That is a &lt;strong&gt;really unsatisfying&lt;/strong&gt; way to end a story. Nissa and Jace figure out the Leylines, Gideon leads the whole people of Zendikar, Chandra burns two gigantic near-invincible titans. Zendikarians themselves would have been completely powerless, and completely irrelevant. That sucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: As &lt;a href=\"/u/EarthtoGeoff\"&gt;u/EarthtoGeoff&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, Nissa is from Zendikar. So yes, not all Zendikarians were irrelevant, sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nahiri pushes her revenge on a whole plane by warping it to lure in the third titan, which is arguably pretty cool, Sorin kills his own creation (OK that\u2019s cool too), gets beaten by Nahiri, Tamiyo breaks her own rules and imprisons the strongest creature of Magic history into a moon. Again, the people of Innistrad were completely useless. On top of that, the gatewatch wasn\u2019t even needed. What was the point of them being there, apart from pushing the set to new players with their faces on it? Yes Jace unravelled some secrets, but someone else could have done that, too. Noone needed the rest of the gatewatch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want to begin with what could have been done before. After Origins, we could have explored the characters more individually. We could have told their stories throughout several blocks, highlighting different planeswalkers in each block. Sometimes one or two could meet, sometimes they could fight, sometimes they could assist each other. Having one or two instead of five or six of the known planeswalkers on a plane changes the story drastically. They would have to rely on people of the plane &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt;, and might just be an important gear in the clockwork, instead of an invincible tool for everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And only after several blocks we could have something like the gatewatch form. That would have been so much more epic. To have wondered how the characters would interact for so long, and finally being rewarded. With Amonkhet, I\u2019m really hoping that the gatewatch disperse afterwards and don\u2019t reform for a few blocks, so we can discover the planeswalkers more individually, and also have much more room for discovering new planes and their people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I want the worlds to be more important on their own. The citizens of the magical planes we discover should be able to hold their own when it comes to the relevance of the story. How many legendary creatures from Battle for Zendikar block can you name? All 13 of them? Do you remember what they did? The story of that plane should be resolved by the people on that plane. Planeswalkers can still have their own meta stories that tie sets together. Magic is more than capable of telling two parallel stories that interconnect in some ways. The big external conflict can be shown in the plane and its characters, like freedom vs safety. It can then be represented with the inner conflict of the planeswalker who has lost loved ones and who is constantly fighting his urges to be in control of everything. Someone who is afraid he might lose his friends if he holds on too tight, but all the same if he doesn\u2019t watch out enough. I think Gideon and Chandra would have been great on Khaladesh without the rest of the watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But most importantly, I wanna know what you think about this. Maybe you disagree completely, and you love seeing the gatewatch on every other card. Or maybe you have some better ideas how this can be solved to be less pseudo-avengers, and tap more into its potential to be the greatest worldbuilding product there is.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**Magic cards are little windows into another world**.

Round 1, I had a bye, so I watched Jay and an Emeria control player. Jay was playing a jank ramp deck, and it ended up as a one-sided sweep. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was having a good time. Looking at the Emeria player&amp;#39;s deck, it seemed like really cool hard control. I playtested with another guy who lost 0-2 pretty quickly - he played an enchantments deck with Kor Spiritdancer. I won my practice games against him, and we both had a good time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Round 2, I played against R/G land destruction against a really great guy. He&amp;#39;s a regular player at my LGS (I&amp;#39;ve played Standard with him on Standard game nights), really helpful, always positive, all-around a fantastic player and person to interact with on FNM. We played 3 more games just for fun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Round 3, I played against a Jeskai Ascendancy player. Again, all-around great guy! Helped me with rulings, I 2-1&amp;#39;d because I dropped an Eidolon on board game 2 so he couldn&amp;#39;t combo out, but he was polite and helpful - he reminded me to look for Grafdigger&amp;#39;s Cage&amp;#39;s to upgrade my sideboard. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I had asked around, and it seemed that the games would be over after 3 rounds. An employee said the prize payout for first place would be, guaranteed, over $28 (my LGS does top 4 rather than top 8). I was really excited - it was my first time ever definitively getting first at an FNM, and at a Modern FNM to boot, with a budget deck! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It turned out there&amp;#39;d be a top 4 face-off, because 3 guys were tied for second and I was first (it was 9-7-7-7). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the part of the story where I make myself look bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t want to do a top 4. I wanted to walk away with first and be able to get enough store credit to complete my Naya Burn deck. I tried to find any way I could grasp onto first and keep it in my hands. I asked my opponent if we could draw. Another player overheard and, well, cussed me out. I was dumbstruck - he called me a fucking bitch, a baby, an idiot, (not jokingly). I shut up and started the game with my opponent. I didn&amp;#39;t know how to react, nodded okay a bunch of times to this guy cussing me out (&amp;quot;Stop being a bitch!&amp;quot; okay &amp;quot;Shut up and play!&amp;quot; okay, etc.) and shuffled up. His behavior, in retrospect, was completely over the top and unjustified. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Game 1, clean sweep. Opponent was running Abzan Company. Game 2, he lands a Viscera Seer and my lack of knowledge of certain Burn interactions surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had lethal with Searing Blazes over the course of the game. However, when I&amp;#39;d Searing Blaze a creature, he&amp;#39;d sac it in response and say it fizzled because one of the targets was now illegal. I dumbly agreed and subsequently lost games 2 and 3 over this specific interaction (because he kept fizzling my Blazes!). 2-1, his favor. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After he reported, I checked the rules and found that he&amp;#39;d gotten the interaction wrong - as long as there&amp;#39;s still a legal target, Searing Blaze does damage to the target. The ruling is &lt;a href=\"http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=193982\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, for my fellow Burn players! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I mentioned to my opponent that this means I should&amp;#39;ve won game 2, and even game 3 if we ignored game 2. The only people remaining in the store except me, the employees, and the other top 3 (including my opponent and the guy who&amp;#39;d cussed me out) had left. I tried showing him the ruling, and the guy who cussed me out (we&amp;#39;ll call him &amp;#39;judge guy,&amp;#39; because he claimed to be a judge) said that I was wrong about it. I had the ruling from the official Magic site on my phone, and he said it was wrong. I found other posts (on MTGSalvation, &lt;a href=\"/r/MagicTCG\"&gt;/r/MagicTCG&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other sites) all saying the same thing - that Searing Blaze&amp;#39;s interaction when one of the targets is illegal still means it resolves, rather than fizzling. He refused to listen to me, and at this point the other 2 players (my opponent and the Emeria guy, who&amp;#39;d been playing Emeria Control against my friend Jay) both agreed with judge guy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They talked over me, refused to look at the ruling on my phone, and made me feel like an idiot. I ended up at third. I was fine with not getting first after the game had been reported, because I hadn&amp;#39;t disputed the Searing Blaze interaction DURING games 2 and 3.
